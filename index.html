        <p>I am a Mauritian girl who grew up in Madagascar and now I am in my first year of Global BBA at ESSEC. I am joyful, kind and I love helping people. It is the first time that I create a website and I made it all by myself ! I find it really interesting.

           I really like visiting new countries and learn about their culture. I have already been to <em>Madagascar, Mauritius, Australia, South Africa, France, Spain and England</em> !! I think that it is already quite a lot but I would also like to visit one day Asian countries such as <em>China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Malaisia</em>,... but also North American countries like <em>Canada or the USA.</em>

        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <p>For now, I am still not really sure about what I would like to do later, in which field I would like to work... So for now, I am just trying different things in different fields. However, one thing that I am sure of is that after doing my Global BBA here in ESSEC, I will do a master somewhere else ! Maybe in Canada
